# Height-and-Weight
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a model to predict the gender of a person based on the height(in inches) and weight(in pounds).

## Dataset Overview
Name: heights_weights

Format: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

Size: [357,388 bytes]

Columns: [Height, Weight, Male] 

## Skills Demonstrated
* Feature Analysis
* Data profiling, Standardization, Normalization, 
* Models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naives Bayes
* Model training testing and predicting
* Accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, r2_score
* Visualization, merging, joining using pandas and matplot libraries

## Insight
1. I had to ensure the data had a balanced gender for male and female so there is no bias

2. The dependent varaiable is a classification so only numerical models could not be used

3. 1 stands for male while 0 stands for female. 

4. Several models were tried to get the best.

5. Logistic Regression was the best model having accuracy score of 92.2%
